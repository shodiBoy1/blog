        <p>
            Hello! I'm <strong>Shodee</strong>, a computer science student and PHP developer on a mission to become a full-stack developer. Like many beginners, I’ve faced countless challenges learning how to build websites by following tutorials that often left me feeling frustrated. Now, I’m here to guide others who are just starting, showing every step—from creating your first folder to deploying your website.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Why am I doing this?</strong> I want to help beginners avoid the pitfalls I experienced. I’ll walk you through building simple HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP websites in easy-to-follow, step-by-step guides. Even though I’m still learning myself, I believe that sharing knowledge is the best way to grow.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m always open to feedback from more experienced developers, so if you’re reading this and have suggestions or advice, feel free to <a href="mailto:shodeeblog@gmail.com" class="link-dark">email me</a>! I’ll also share my experiences as a student, insights into computer science topics, and the resources that have helped me along the way.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active by running and swimming, and I try to keep a balance between intellectual challenges and physical activity.

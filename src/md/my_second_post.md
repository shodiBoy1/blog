## The Importance of HTML Semantics

HTML is the backbone of every web page. However, as web development has evolved, so has the need to write **clean**, **semantic** HTML. But what does that mean?

Semantic HTML refers to using elements that clearly describe their meaning in a way that both the browser and the developer can understand. Consider these examples:

```html
<!-- Non-semantic -->
<div>Header Section</div>
<div>Main Content</div>

<!-- Semantic -->
<header>Header Section</header>
<main>Main Content</main>

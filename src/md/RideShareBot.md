# Introducing RideShareBot: Your Ultimate Ride-Sharing Companion on Telegram

Looking for a ride? Or maybe you're offering one? Meet **RideShareBot** – a custom Telegram bot I developed to simplify finding and offering rides within your city or even cross-country! Built with convenience in mind, RideShareBot is here to connect riders and drivers efficiently. Here’s a rundown of what it offers.

> **Note:** The bot’s username was initially created as @TakeWithBot during early testing, and although I later chose a new name, Telegram does not currently support renaming usernames.


## 🚀 How It Works

RideShareBot operates on Telegram, where users can either search for available rides or post their own. The bot allows for direct interaction and facilitates all the essential details riders and drivers need to make informed decisions.

### Main Features

1. **Find a Ride**: Users can quickly check for available  rides and get connected with drivers who have open seats.
2. **Offer a Ride**: Drivers can post details about their trip, including the destination, departure time, and seat availability.
3. **Country-Based Filtering**: To keep it organized, the bot categorizes rides by country channels. If a channel for a particular country doesn't exist, RideShareBot will create it on the fly and post the ride details there.(coming soon)
4. **Automatic Posting to Public Channel**: All ride requests and offers are posted automatically to the public channel, making it easy for everyone to see available options. Join the channel to stay updated: [RideShare Channel](https://t.me/ride_share_de).
5. **Contact Information**: RideShareBot ensures all rides include contact information, allowing users to reach out easily.



## 📝 Detailed User Experience

When you start with RideShareBot, you’ll have two primary options:

- **Need a Ride**: Select this to find a ride. The bot will prompt you to enter your starting city, destination, departure date, time, number of seats needed, and your contact info. Once complete, your ride request is posted automatically to the public channel for others to view and respond.

- **Offer a Ride**: Drivers can use this to post a ride. You’ll enter details like your starting city, destination, date, time, available seats, price per person, car model, and contact info. Once submitted, the ride offer is automatically posted to the public channel, making it visible to users searching for a ride.



## 📄 Terms of Use

By using RideShareBot, you agree to its disclaimer. The bot serves as a facilitator, but users should arrange the specifics directly with each other and remain responsible for verifying all details.

**Disclaimer**: RideShareBot is not liable for any disputes, incidents, or legal issues that may arise during rides arranged through the platform.



## ⚙️ Technology Stack

This bot is powered by:

- **Java**: Developed using Java, leveraging Telegram’s Java API.
- **Telegram Bots API**: Allows for seamless messaging, updating, and channel management within Telegram.



## 🌍 Expanding Capabilities

In the future, I plan to implement more filtering options, such as sorting by cities and adding automated responses to common questions. My goal is to build a community of riders and drivers who feel safe, informed, and connected.
